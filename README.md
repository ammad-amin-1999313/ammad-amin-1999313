I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in React.js, Next.js, and various other frameworks that support modern web development. Currently, I'm actively working with Next.js, React.js, Sanity, and MongoDB.

I'm always open to collaboration opportunities in web development projects. If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me via email at: sardarammad6@gmail.com.
